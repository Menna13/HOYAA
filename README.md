# ThinkGREEN

ThinkGREEN is an app that helps in saving the environment by making people aware of their daily usage and their carbon footprint. 
The idea is to give people simple and meaningful interpretations of their usage instead of just giving them technical numbers. 

### The app has three major commands:

1. Given origin, destination, and mean of transportation, it calculates carbon footprint and gives a metaphor of how much is this carbon footprint in terms of other 
   everyday consumption, like playing videogames or using a vacuum cleaner for X hours.
2. Given a US state, the application returns the average electricity consumption in the state given and the rank of the state compared to other US states. 
   Then, an advice is given on what the optimal consumption is and how to fix it. An example of a piece of advice would be: "Turning your lights off before 
   going to sleep will make you consume X less and thus become only Y away from the optimal.
3. Given any country, the application returns a list of all the environmental organizations that one can contribute to/get involved with.

*The app is still under development.*
